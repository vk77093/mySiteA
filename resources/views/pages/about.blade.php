<p class="compDesc">Back in 1950, a single man, Mr. Harbans Lal Sharma, born to a disciplined & fiercely patriotic family in Punjab, envisioned a global manufacturing unit & started Vijay Cycles and Steel Industries. Thence was born the HR-Group that specialized in hand tools production at a global level. By now, the company was managed by its second & third generation and had become a force to reckon with. But as the group grew, so did the entrepreneurial spirit of the heirs.</p>
<p class="compDesc">It was no surprise then that one of the grandsons, Sushant Sharma decided to take his passion for world-cuisine to another level and started Foodcoast International. Today, Foodcoast International is a globally renowned enterprise that produces the best quality sauces, mayonnaise & other packaged foods.</p>
<p class="compDesc">Chocolate is perhaps the world’s most favourite food. The tendency to crave sugary foods like chocolate is especially high in children. Give a kid a piece of chocolate, and he’ll feel like the luckiest one on the earth, at least until the chocolate lasts. This is exactly what happened with young Aryaman, Sushant’s sweet little son with a sweet-tooth. Seeing Aryaman joyfully nibble at his chocolate made him ponder about the lack of premium quality chocolates and the desire to do “something” about it.</p>
<p class="compDesc">This “something” set him off on a relentless pursuit of a chocolate that is pure, that people could really taste: from single-origin bars that celebrate each bean’s flavour profile to couvertures custom-made for the choosiest of chocolate lovers. And thus was born “Aaria”, a love story that begins from childhood and lasts forever…</p>

<p class="compDesc">Keen to make chocolate from the bean, Sushant was drawn to the common threads he saw in working with Crea International, a pioneer Italian chocolate manufacturer founded in 1978. Crea boasts of a state-of-the-art-facility site in Cuneo with a production area of 120,000 metre sq. & is equipped with the latest production and traceability technologies. A deep knowledge in choosing raw materials, long experience in processing them, combined with the flexibility of a carefully controlled production cycle, makes Crea a unique company in this field. Semi-finished cocoa, bean to chocolate and dry fruits are meticulously produced in-house in order to check each working step & produce the finest of products. A joint venture that brought together the expertise of Crea and the passion of Foodcoast International was thus, ‘a marriage made in heaven’ – giving birth to the Aaria – Premium line of chocolates.</p>
<blockquote class="compDesc">All of us at Aaria family take great pleasure in introducing you to the very delicate but intrinsic balance of absolute purity and sheer flavour, hallmarks of the subtle, lingering delight of Aaria – Premium line of chocolates.</blockquote>
